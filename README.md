## Project Overview

This project focuses on handwritten digit classification using neural network-based approaches.
The objective is to explore and compare different deep learning architectures for image recognition,
with an emphasis on performance evaluation and model behavior analysis.

The project includes the implementation and training of:

- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** for baseline digit classification.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to leverage spatial features in image data.

All models are implemented in **Python** using **TensorFlow with the Keras API** and trained on the
**MNIST dataset**, which contains grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9) collected from a
variety of scanned documents and normalized in size and alignment.
